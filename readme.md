A minimalist, single-author blogging platform focused on clean writing and authentic publishing.

## 📚 Purpose

I built **SoloWriter** to explore the idea of distraction-free digital publishing. The goal was to create a personal writing tool where the focus remains on content, not clutter.

## 🚀 How to Set It Up

> Note: This is a personal project and not open source, but here's a high-level setup guide for reference:

1. Set up a Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore.
2. Add Firebase config to your local `.env` or inline in the JS.
3. Deploy to a static host like Netlify.

## 🧠 What I Focused On

* Designing around content-first principles
* Handling real-time updates with Firestore
* Keeping everything simple, performant, and mobile-friendly
* Managing layout state (modes, auth, editing) without external libraries
